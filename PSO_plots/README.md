# RLPSO Hyperparameter Tuning Visualization

This React application visualizes the results of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning of a neural network.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the visualization on your local machine:

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will now run at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Features

The visualization includes:

**1. PSO hyperparameter tuning**
**2. RLPSO hyperparameter tuning**
**3. Bayesian hyperparameter tuning**

Currently bayesian outperforms RLPSO
